The goal of this repository is to create a clean drop down menu page.

Inside of this repo you will find the code that will allow you to create:
- several drop down menus
- with animation
- checkboxes
- one menu will appear at a time
- the stored information should be saved in a database


Lanugages/frameworks used:
- JavaScript (jquery)
- HTML
- CSS
- Postgresql


For the CSS grid I looked up a tutorial:
http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system
- from here to took the basics and adjusted/personalized it to my needs
